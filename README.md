# nodejs-console-menu-interface
This repository provides a ready-to-use boilerplate for quickly creating projects in a command console system style. The purpose of this boilerplate is to save developers time by providing a foundation that handles common console system functionalities, allowing developers to focus on their core logic.



## Usage
To utilize the boilerplate, focus in the actions folder:

 - src/actions: A directory that contains the action modules for the console system.
 - src/backToMainMenu.js: A module that provides functionality for returning to the main menu.
Customizable actions: The src/actions directory is designed for easily adding or modifying actions according to your project's requirements. Each action is represented by a separate module, allowing you to focus on implementing your core logic.

Interactive command-line interface: The console system utilizes the inquirer library, providing an intuitive and interactive command-line interface for users to navigate through the menu and select actions.

## Run
```
$ node index
```
